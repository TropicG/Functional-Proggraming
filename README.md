Here you can find various problems and homework I have to do for the course "Functional Programming" in Faculty of Mathmathics and Informatics at Sofia University. In this course we have covered two functional languages such as Racket and Haskell.

Here is what we have covered with Racket and what you are about to see in this repostory:
- syntax
- procedurs
- anonymous procedurs
- working and understanding lists and pairs

Here is whaw we have covered with Haskell and what are you about to see in this repostory:
- syntax
- procedurs
- anonumous precedurs
- pattern matching
- working and understanding lists and pairs

Also this repostory includes problems given to us during exams.
